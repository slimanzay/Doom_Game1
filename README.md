# we will create a game for this we use the principles and techniques on which the Wolfenstein 3d game is built and also stylize it as a doom game.
# we need to know that Wolfenstein 3d is based on the ray casting algorithm in reality it is performed on a two-dimensional plane.
# with the help of a raycaster we will get a 3d projection on our game level.
# The initial structure of the project will consist of five files.
1)	Main file.py and player.py 
2)	Object-renderer.py
3)	Raycasting.py
4)	Map.py
5)	Settings.py

# The settings file will store the main game settings 
# Now you can go to the main file and write the main application template 
# map.py this will be a two-dimensional array in which digital values
